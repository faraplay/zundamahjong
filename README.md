Web-based Mahjong game.

## Quick Start

Install `zundamahjong` into a Python virtual environment with

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install zundamahjong
```

To start the bundled WSGI server, listening at the port `PORT`, run

```sh
python -m zundamahjong [-p PORT]  # defaults to 5000
```

> [!WARNING]
> The bundled WSGI server should not be used in production.

## Running in Production

Install Gunicorn (or some other [production WSGI server](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/deploying/))
to your virtual environment with

```sh
pip install gunicorn
```

You'll need to generate a secret key for Flask to sign sessions. As an
example, you can run

```python
>>> import secrets
>>> print(secrets.token_hex())
```

and pass the result to `zundamahjong` through the `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
environment variable.

Once you've figured out how to do that, tell Gunicorn to start `zundamahjong`
up by running

```sh
gunicorn --threads 100 --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 zundamahjong.server:app
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to run Gunicorn [behind a reverse proxy](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html)
> such as nginx. But make sure to proxy [WebSocket requests](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html)
> to Gunicorn! If you don't, Socket.IO will fall back to using HTTP
> long-polling.

### Database configuration

By default, `zundamahjong` uses a SQLite database with filename `debug.db` in
the working directory.

To instead use a PostgreSQL database, you'll have to install the needed
optional dependencies with

```sh
pip install 'zundamahjong[postgresql]'
```

The database connection is configured using environment variables. Check the
`.env.example` file.

## Hacking on zundamahjong

Set up a Python virtual environment and the project's dependencies with

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

To install the Node.js dependencies, navigate to the `client` folder and run

```sh
npm install
```

Start the bundled Werkzeug server in debug mode by running

```sh
uv run -m zundamahjong --debug
```

This will take care of starting the [Vite](https://vite.dev/) debug server in
the background and proxy requests for static assets directly to it. You are
free to start it manually (before running the above!) by navigating to the
`client` folder and running

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Generating password hashes

To reset a user's password if they have forgotten it, you can use

```python
>>> from getpass import getpass
>>> from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
>>> print(generate_password_hash(getpass()))
```

and then input the result manually into the application database.
